            <h1>Welcome to Browsing URL Sequence Study</h1>
            <h3> Protocol Number: STUDY2025_00000079 </h3>

            <p>
                This study collects browsing URL sequences to investigate the browsing behaviors of Internet 
                participants. Participants will submit their recent browsing history (a sequence of URLs and the corresponding visit time) to a 
                web interface we provide.  
                <br> <br>
                To participate in the study and to upload your browsing hisotry, you will first need to go over our online consent form and grant consent to the study. 
                <br> <br>
                You will enter your worker id and get assigned a random API key in order to log in the study. 
                <br> <br>
                In each URL sequence you submit, you will enter 15 valid entertaiment-related URL and their visited times in a specific day of your browsing history within the 1-year timeframe in the past. The requirements will be further noted in FAQ of the submission page. 
                <br> <br>
                You can submit up to 10 URL sequences of your browsing history on 10 different days. You can exit the study at any time if you no longer wish to participate. Your compensation will be prorated according to the number of submission you made. 
                <br> <br>
                The browser cookie will record your worker id and a randomly assigned user id only to track the number of valid submissions you make for compensation approval.  
                <br> <br>
                If you decline the online consent, you can safely exit the website and your information will not be recorded.
